 # Spring Boot Role-Based Access with JWT Authentication

This project demonstrates role-based access control (RBAC) using Spring Security in a Spring Boot application. It includes user authentication and authorization through JWT (JSON Web Token). The system defines two roles: **User** and **Admin**, each with different access levels.

## Features
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented roles for User and Admin.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login and session management using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Spring Security**: Used for authentication and authorization to protect APIs.
- **Custom Access Rules**: Defined access restrictions for different user roles.
- **Journal Entries**: Users can create, read, update, and delete their journal entries.
- **Admin Features**: Admin can view all users, create new admins.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: The backend framework used to build the application.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **JWT**: Used for token-based authentication to secure endpoints.
- **Maven**: Project build management.
  


You can find the example JSON files for testing the application in the repository under the `json/` directory. Here are the steps to access and use them:

1. **Navigate to the `json/` directory**:
    The example JSON files are located in the `json/` folder in the root of the project. This folder contains sample payloads for various API requests, such as creating journal entries, updating user roles, and creating new admin users.

    ```bash
    cd json
    ```

2. **Use the JSON files**:
    Copy and paste this Json file into Postman or any testing tool.


By using this files, you can easily test the application's functionality.
